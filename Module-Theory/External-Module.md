**What is a Node.js External Module?**

A Node.js external module is a JavaScript file or a directory containing JavaScript files that are not part of your project's core codebase. These modules are typically installed from external sources, such as the npm registry or other package managers. They provide additional functionalities or libraries that can be used in your Node.js applications.

**Why Use Node.js External Modules?**

1. **Leverage Community-Built Solutions:** External modules offer a vast ecosystem of pre-built solutions for various tasks, saving you time and effort.
2. **Access Specialized Functionalities:** You can find modules for specific domains like database interactions, web scraping, machine learning, and more.
3. **Maintainability and Reusability:** Using well-maintained external modules can improve code quality and reusability.
4. **Stay Up-to-Date:** External modules are often updated with bug fixes, new features, and security improvements, ensuring your applications are current.
5. **Community Support:** Many external modules have active communities that provide support, documentation, and examples.

**How to Use Node.js External Modules:**

1. **Install the Module:** Use a package manager like npm or yarn to install the desired external module.

   ```bash
   npm install <module-name>
   ```

2. **Import the Module:** In your Node.js application, use the `require()` function to import the installed module.

   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const mysql = require('mysql2');
   ```

3. **Use Module Functions and Properties:** Once imported, you can access the module's functions and properties using dot notation.

   ```javascript
   const app = express();
   const connection = mysql.createConnection({
       host: 'localhost',
       user: 'your_user',
       password: 'your_password',
       database: 'your_database'
   });
   ```
